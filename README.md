# TUK-TUK
The "Tuk Tuk" project is a comprehensive E-Rickshaw Fleet Management App that integrates hardware and frontend development to enhance the operational efficiency, safety, and profitability of e-rickshaw operations. The app utilizes a combination of Bluetooth-enabled hardware, including Arduino, HC05, IR blaster sensor, and motor driver L293D, to gather real-time data from e-rickshaws. The frontend development ensures a user-friendly interface for both fleet managers and drivers.

Key features of the Tuk Tuk app include:

1. Real-Time Motor and Battery Data Tracking:
   - Provides live monitoring of motor performance and battery health.
   - Allows fleet managers to track the status of each e-rickshaw in real time.

2. Geo-Tracking:
   - Enables precise location tracking of e-rickshaws.
   - Facilitates route optimization and enhances overall fleet management.

3. Geo-Fencing:
   - Offers a premium feature in higher subscription plans.
   - Allows users to set geographical boundaries for e-rickshaws, enhancing security and control.

4. Predictive Maintenance Alerts:
   - Alerts fleet managers about potential maintenance issues based on real-time data.
   - Aids in reducing unexpected downtimes and optimizing maintenance schedules.

5. Customization and Add-Ons:
   - Provides flexibility with optional add-ons and customization options for users.
   - Allows users to tailor their experience based on specific requirements.

6. User-Friendly Interface:
   - Ensures an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for both fleet managers and drivers.
   - Enhances the overall user experience.

7. Bluetooth Connectivity:
   - Utilizes Bluetooth communication (HC05) to establish a seamless connection between the app and e-rickshaws.
   - Enables data sharing and remote control functionalities.

8. Safety Features:
   - Incorporates IR blaster sensor for obstacle detection and collision avoidance.
   - Enhances driver awareness and contributes to overall safety.

The project aims to address common challenges in the e-rickshaw industry, such as monitoring vehicle health, optimizing routes, and ensuring a smooth operation. By combining hardware and software solutions, Tuk Tuk provides a holistic approach to fleet management, contributing to the sustainability and efficiency of e-rickshaw transportation.
